contains:
[bin], [number of items in bin]

where [bin]'s value is the number of collisions-1, e.g

1, 1000 => there are 1000 packets with unique size
2, 100 => there are 100 packets that each have a unique other packet of the same size
3, 10 => there are 10 packets that can be confused with 2 other packets if you look at the size
